As part of the course Internet Technology, we were assigned to work through the first ten chapters of tango with django.

This books takes a learner through the process of developing a web application called Rango using Python and Django.

Rango lets users browser through user-defined categories to access user-defined categories and access various web pages.

This repository only covers the first 10 chapters as testing was only done up to this point. A fuller version will be fleshed out in the repository named "tango_with_django_two".
